# We assume that node and npm is installed.

1. Install express globally (-g)
   npm install -g express-generator
2. Create an express project
   express -c stylus express_example : where, c - using stylus for css or just express <project_name>
3. Move to project directory and install npm 
   cd express_example && npm install
4. Boot the application 
   DEBUG=express_example:* npm start
   Will be working on this port =  http://127.0.0.1:3000 
   You can change you port in file www
   #var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000');
5. Install nodemon so you wont have to restart your application each time you make any changes.
   When application is started with nodemon, it automatically reload your application on the fly.
   Install -> npm install -g nodemon
   Start   -> DEBUG=express_example:* nodemon
